# Web Summary AI Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: November 18, 2025

### Zero Data Collection

Web Summary AI is built with absolute privacy as the foundation. We collect ZERO data. Period.

## What Data We Collect

### NOTHING. ZERO. NADA.
- **No tracking**: We don't track your activity
- **No analytics**: We don't use Google Analytics or any analytics service
- **No logs**: We don't log your usage
- **No telemetry**: We don't send any data anywhere
- **No user IDs**: We don't generate or store any identifiers

## How We Use Your Data

### We Don't
- Your page content is processed locally or sent directly to free AI providers
- We never see, store, or transmit your data
- All processing happens on-demand when you click the summarize button
- Nothing is saved, logged, or transmitted to any server we control

### Local Storage Only
- Settings (AI provider choice, custom prompts) are stored locally in your browser
- You can clear all stored data through browser settings
- No data ever leaves your device except to AI providers YOU choose

## Data Sharing

### We Have Nothing to Share
- No servers to send data to
- No databases to store information
- No third-party services except the AI provider you select
- Your data goes directly from your browser to the AI provider

### Third-Party AI Services
- When using Hugging Face: Your data is sent directly to Hugging Face (free, no account required)
- When using local mode: Everything stays on your device
- We act only as a local interface - no middleman servers

## Your Rights and Controls

### Complete Privacy
- Nothing to view because nothing is collected
- Nothing to delete because nothing is stored (except local settings)
- Nothing to opt-out of because there's no tracking
- Uninstall the extension to remove all data

### Transparency Features
- Real-time logging of all operations
- User-accessible data viewer
- Clear indicators when data is being processed

## Security Measures

### Local Processing
- Most summarization happens locally in your browser
- No data leaves your device unless you explicitly choose external processing

### Secure Storage
- API keys are stored encrypted in browser storage
- No sensitive data is cached unnecessarily
